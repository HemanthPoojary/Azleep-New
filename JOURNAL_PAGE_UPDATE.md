# Journal Page Update - Canvas to List View & AI Chatbot Enhancement

## Issues Fixed
1. The user reported that the Journal page was still showing a Canvas view instead of the expected List view for journal entries.
2. Found and enhanced chatbot references throughout the codebase for better consistency and functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced JournalList Component (`src/components/journal/JournalList.tsx`)

**Previous State:** Basic list component that used incorrect table (`journals` instead of `journal_entries`)

**Updated Features:**
- ✅ **Correct Database Integration**: Now uses `journal_entries` table
- ✅ **Quick Entry Area**: Added textarea for quick journal entries with auto-save
- ✅ **Auto-Save Indicator**: Shows save status (idle/saving/saved/error)
- ✅ **Relaxation Points Integration**: Awards 15 points for journal entries
- ✅ **Enhanced UI**: Improved cards with mood indicators and emojis
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Uses React Query for automatic list refresh
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery

**Key Features Added:**
```typescript
// Quick entry with auto-save
const handleSaveQuickEntry = async () => {
  // Saves to journal_entries table
  // Awards relaxation points
  // Refreshes the list automatically
}

// Enhanced mood display
const getMoodEmoji = (mood) => {
  // Returns appropriate emoji for each mood
}

const getMoodColor = (mood) => {
  // Returns color for mood badges
}
```

### 2. Updated Journal Page (`src/pages/JournalPage.tsx`)

**Key Changes:**
- 🔄 **Replaced Canvas with List**: Changed default view from `'canvas'` to `'list'`
- 🤖 **Enhanced Chatbot UI**: Changed "Chat" to "AI Assistant" with robot icon
- ➕ **Added JournalList**: Now uses the enhanced list component as default
- 🎮 **Improved Gamification**: Uses relaxation points hook for real points/streaks
- 🔧 **Fixed Modal Props**: Corrected JournalEntryModal prop interface

**View Toggle Updated:**
```typescript
// Before: ['canvas', 'prompts', 'voice'] with "Chat" label
// After: ['list', 'prompts', 'voice'] with "AI Assistant" label

const [activeView, setActiveView] = useState<'list' | 'prompts' | 'voice'>('list');

// UI now shows:
<Bot className="h-4 w-4 mr-1" />
AI Assistant
```

**Component Rendering:**
```typescript
{activeView === 'list' ? (
  <JournalList onEntrySaved={handleJournalEntryComplete} />
) : activeView === 'prompts' ? (
  <JournalPrompts /> 
) : (
  <VoiceJournal />
)}
```
